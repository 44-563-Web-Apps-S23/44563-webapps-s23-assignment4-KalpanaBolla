WHITE DRESSES

     TIME: _The evening before Christmas, 1900_.

     SCENE: _The scene is laid in a negro cabin, the home of_ CANDACE
     _and_ MARY MCLEAN, _in eastern North Carolina_.

     _In the right corner of the room is a rough bed covered with a
     ragged counterpane. In the centre at the rear is an old bureau with
     a cracked mirror, to the left of it a door opening to the outside.
     In the left wall is a window with red curtains. A large chest
     stands near the front on this side, and above it hang the family
     clothes, several ragged dresses, an old bonnet, and a cape. At the
     right, toward the front, is a fireplace, in which a small fire is
     burning. Above and at the sides of the fireplace hang several pots
     and pans, neatly arranged. Above these is a mantel, covered with a
     lambrequin of dingy red crape paper. On the mantel are bottles and
     a clock. A picture of "Daniel in the Lion's Den" hangs above the
     mantel. The walls are covered with newspapers, to which are pinned
     several illustrations clipped from popular magazines. A rough table
     is in the centre of the room. A lamp without a chimney is on it.
     Several chairs are about the room. A rocking-chair with a rag
     pillow in it stands near the fire. There is an air of cleanliness
     and poverty about the whole room._

     _The rising of the curtain discloses the empty room. The fire is
     burning dimly._ AUNT CANDACE _enters at the rear, carrying several
     sticks of firewood under one arm. She walks with a stick, and is
     bent with rheumatism. She is dressed in a slat bonnet, which hides
     her face in its shadow, brogan shoes, a man's ragged coat, a
     checkered apron, a dark-colored dress. She mumbles to herself and
     shakes her head as she comes in. With great difficulty she puts the
     wood on the fire, and then takes the poker and examines some
     potatoes that are cooking in the ashes. She takes out her snuff-box
     and puts snuff in her lip. As she does this her bonnet is pushed
     back, and in the firelight her features are discernible--sunken
     eyes, high cheek-bones, and big, flat nose. Upon her forehead she
     wears a pair of steel-rimmed spectacles._

     _She sits down in a rocking-chair, now and then putting her hand to
     her head, and groaning as if in pain. She turns and looks
     expectantly toward the door. After a moment she hobbles to the
     chest on the right and takes out an old red crocheted fascinator.
     Shivering she wraps it around her neck and stands looking down in
     the chest. She lifts out a little black box and starts to unfasten
     it, when the door suddenly opens and_ MARY MCLEAN _comes in_. AUNT
     CANDACE _puts the box hastily back into the chest, and hurries to
     the fire_.

     MARY MCLEAN _has a "turn" of collards in one arm and a paper bundle
     in the other. She lays the collards on the floor near the window
     and puts her shawl on the bed. She is a quadroon girl about
     eighteen years old, with an oval face and a mass of fine dark hair,
     neatly done up. There is something in her bearing that suggests a
     sort of refinement. Her dress is pitifully shabby, her shoes
     ragged. But even this cannot hide the lines of an almost perfect
     figure. For a negro she is pretty. As she comes up to the fire her
     pinched lips and the tired expression on her face are plainly
     visible. Only her eyes betray any signs of excitement._

AUNT CANDACE. Honey, I's been a-waitin' foh you de las' two hours. My
haid's been bad off. Chile, whah you been? Miss Mawgin must a had a
pow'ful washin' up at de big house.

     [MARY _opens her hand and shows her a five-dollar bill_.

AUNT CANDACE. De Lawd help my life, chile!

MARY. An' look here what Mr. Henry sent you, too. [_She undoes the
bundle, revealing several cooked sweet potatoes, sausages, spareribs,
and some boiled ham._] He said as 'twas Christmas time he sent you this
with the collards there.

     [_She points toward the collards at the window._ AUNT CANDACE _pays
     little attention to the food as_ MARY _places it in her lap, but
     continues to look straight into_ MARY'S _face. The girl starts to
     give her the money, but she pushes her away._

AUNT CANDACE. [_Excitedly._] Whah'd you git dat, honey? Whah'd you git
it? Mr. Henry ain't never been dat kind befo'. Dey ain't no past
Christmas times he was so free wid 'is money. He ain't de kind o' man
foh dat. An' he a-havin' 'is washin' done on Christmas Eve. [_Her look
is direct and troubled._] Chile, Mr. Hugh didn't give you dat money, did
he?

MARY. [_Still looking in the fire._] Aunty, I ain't said Mr. Henry sent
you this money. Yes'm, Mr. Hugh sent it to you. I done some washin' for
him. I washed his socks and some shirts--pure silk they was. [_She
smiles at the remembrance._] An' he give me the money an' tole me to
give it to you--said he wished he could give you somethin' more.

     [_She hands the money to_ AUNT CANDACE, _who takes it quickly_.

AUNT CANDACE. Help my soul an' body! De boy said dat! Bless 'is soul! He
ain't fo'got 'is ol' aunty, even if he ain't been to see 'er since he
come back from school way out yander. De Lawd bless 'im! Allus was a
good boy, an' he ain't changed since he growed up nuther. When I useter
nuss 'im he'd never whimper, no suh. Bring me de tin box, honey. An'
don't notice what I's been sayin'. I spects I's too perticler 'bout you.
I dunno.

     [MARY _goes to the bureau and gets a tin box. She puts the money
     in it, returns it, and lights the lamp._ AUNT CANDACE _takes off
     her bonnet and hangs it behind her on the rocking-chair. Then she
     begins to eat greedily, now and then licking the grease off her
     fingers. Suddenly she utters a low scream, putting her hands to her
     head and rocking to and fro. She grasps her stick and begins
     beating about her as if striking at something, crying out in a loud
     voice._

AUNT CANDACE. Ah-hah, I'll git you! I'll git you!

     [MARY _goes to her and pats her on the cheek_.

MARY. It's your poor head, ain't it, aunty? You rest easy, I'll take
care of you. [_She continues to rub her cheek and forehead until the
spell passes._] Set still till I git in a turn of light-wood. It's goin'
to be a terrible cold night an' looks like snow.
