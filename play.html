        <h4 class="mary">MARY</h4> <p class="speech">An' look here what Mr. Henry sent you, too. </p><p class="direction">[_She undoes the bundle, revealing several cooked sweet potatoes, sausages, spareribs, and some boiled ham._]</p><p class="speech" >He said as 'twas Christmas time he sent you this with the collards there.
       _She points toward the collards at the window._ AUNT CANDACE _pays little attention to the food as_ MARY _places it in her lap, but continues to look straight into_ MARY'S _face. The girl starts to give her the money, but she pushes her away._</p> <p class="direction">[_Excitedly._]</p> <p class="speech">Whah'd you git dat, honey? Whah'd you git it? Mr. Henry ain't never been dat kind befo'. Dey ain't no past Christmas times he was so free wid 'is money. He ain't de kind o' man foh dat. An' he a-havin' 'is washin' done on Christmas Eve. </p><p>[_Her look is direct and troubled._] </p><p class="speech">Chile, Mr. Hugh didn't give you dat money, did he?</p>
       <p class="direction">[_Still looking in the fire._]</p> <p class="speech">Aunty, I ain't said Mr. Henry sent
        you this money. Yes'm, Mr. Hugh sent it to you. I done some washin' for
        him. I washed his socks and some shirts--pure silk they was.</p>

       <h4 class="aunt_candace">AUNT CANDACE</h4> <p class="speech">Help my soul an' body! De boy said dat! Bless 'is soul! He
       ain't fo'got 'is ol' aunty, even if he ain't been to see 'er since he
       come back from school way out yander. Suddenly she utters a low scream, putting her hands to her
       head and rocking to and fro. She grasps her stick and begins beating about her as if striking at something, crying out in a loud voice._</p>

       <h4 class="aunt_candace">AUNT CANDACE</h4> <p class="speech">Ah-hah, I'll git you! I'll git you!
       <p class="direction">[MARY _goes to her and pats her on the cheek_.</p>

    <h4 class="mary">MARY</h4> <p class="speech">It's your poor head, ain't it, aunty? You rest easy, I'll take
     care of you.</p><p class="direction"> [_She continues to rub her cheek and forehead until the
     spell passes._]</p> <p class="speech">Set still till I git in a turn of light-wood. It's goin'
     to be a terrible cold night an' looks like snow.</p>

    <h4 class="aunt_candace">AUNT CANDACE</h4> <p class="speech">I's better now, honey. Put it back up. I ain't gwine take

    sausages, an' I ain't gwine take no medicine. <p class="direction"> [MARY _puts the bottle and spoon back on the mantel and sits down_. AUNT CANDACE _stops eating and
    looks at_ MARY'S _dreaming face_.]</p> Honey, what makes you look like dat? <p class="direction">[_Excitedly._]</p><p>Mr. Henry ain't said ... he ain't said no mo' 'bout us havin' to leave, has he?</p>

    <p class="direction">[_Looking up confusedly._]</p></p class="speech"> No'm, he ... no'm, he said ... he said to-day that he'd 'bout decided to let us stay right on as long as we please.</p>
